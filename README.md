- 👋 Hi, I’m @KellyC0117. I LOVE data analysis and creating new knowledge. I have a PhD in Educational Psychology from UW Seattle, and was highly trained on SPSS. However, after leaving university, the cost of SPSS was prohibitive.  I have been looking for ways to use my statistical and research methods knowledge and ran across the Google Analytics program where I could start learning new tools for what I love to do, including coding. 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about coding to create and analyze PreK-12 education data sets.  I am also interested in projects involving community safety data analysis (e.g. traffic, crime, public health). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning through the Google Data Analytics programs where I learned about GitHub.  Not sure how to use it yet and hoping I don't make an error!
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate with anyone who has made the switch from SPSS and/or is working with educational data or on community safety projects.
