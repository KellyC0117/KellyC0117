- 👋 Hi, I’m @KellyC0117.  I have a PhD in Educational Psychology and was highly trained on SPSS. I LOVE data analysis and creating new knowledge.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about data science to create and analyze PreK-12 education data sets, using coding techniques.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning through the Google Data Analytics programs (currently in the advanced program).  I learned about GitHub there.  Not sure how to use it yet and hoping I don't make an error!
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate with anyone who has made the switch from SPSS or is working with educational data.
- 📫 How to reach me kcoughlan0117@gmail.com
